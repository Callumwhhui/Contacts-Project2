Welcome to Contactify! This web application allows users to efficiently manage their contacts, providing a convenient way to store and organize essential information. Contactify is built using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose, providing a robust and scalable solution for contact management.

## Features 

- User Sign-Up/Log-In
- Add/View Contacts
- Add Work Infomation
- Delete Contacts

## Future Improvements 

- I want to add a feature so that the user could put contacts into groups (favourite/emergency).
- I want to add a feature that allows the user to be able to search/sort throught their contacts.
- It would be nice to also add a feature that lets the user email one of their contacts directly from the app.
